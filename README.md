# Minesweeper 
Eric's junky C# Minesweeper clone.

## Getting started
This project assumes you've got `mono`.  You should probably see a doctor.

1. Clone the repo and cd into the project directory.
2. `make deps` to install all dependencies.
3. `make test` to run the tests.
4. `make run` to play a sweet game!
